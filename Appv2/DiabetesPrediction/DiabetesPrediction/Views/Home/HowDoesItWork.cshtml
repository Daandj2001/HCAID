It will evaluate whether you have diabetes or not by comparing your answers with answers of thousands of other people.

<p style="font-size:18px;">The computer uses its knowledge to give you a prediction whether you have diabetes or not. It is important to remember this is a prediction not a definitive answer. No doctor or other specialist has looked at your data, this means it is not always 100% accurate. If you have doubts about the prediction or it predicts that you have diabetes make sure to contact a doctor.</p>
